## Service Container
The [service manager](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Manager/ServiceManager.php) can access multiple containers via the [ArrayAccess](http://php.net/manual/en/class.arrayaccess.php) interface and allows them and other services to be grouped together. See the [service](https://github.com/mvc5/application/blob/master/config/service.php) configuration in the [demo application](https://github.com/mvc5/application) for examples. Values from these containers can be accessed using the [arrow](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Resolver/Args.php#L53) notation [Blog->Home](https://github.com/mvc5/application/blob/master/config/route.php#L10). A container can be either an array or an [ArrayAccess](http://php.net/manual/en/class.arrayaccess.php) object and can contain any type of value, except for null. A [resolvable](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Resolver/Resolvable.php) will be resolved by its closest parent [service manager](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Manager/ServiceManager.php). If the container is a [Container\Config](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Container/Config.php) or a [ServiceContainer](https://github.com/mvc5/framework/blob/master/src/Service/Container/ServiceContainer.php) object, all of its values are considered to be service configurations and are resolved accordingly. This includes strings, arrays, and anonymous functions. If necessary, the [ServiceConfig](#serviceconfighttpsgithubcommvc5frameworkblobmastersrcserviceconfigserviceconfigserviceconfigphp) configuration can be used to retrieve their configuration value without resolving it.
