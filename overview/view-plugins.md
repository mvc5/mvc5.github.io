### View Plugins
The default [view model](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/ViewModel.php) supports [service configurations](#dependency-injection) and [plugins](/plugins) that must resolve to a [callable](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php) type. This requires a [service locator](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/Service/Service.php) to be injected prior to being [rendered](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/View/Template/Render.php). However, because a [view model](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/ViewModel.php) can be created by a controller, this may not of happened. To overcome this, the current [service locator](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/Service/Service.php) will be [injected](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/View/Template/Model.php#L49) into the [view model](https://github.com/mvc5/mvc5/blob/master/src/ViewModel.php) if it does not already have one. Below is an example of the [url generator](#url-generator).
```php
<a href="<?= $this->url(['dashboard', 'user' => 'phpdev']) ?>">Dashboard</a>
```
